      <p class="w3-large">Hello! My name is Lilly Papalia, and I am a senior studying mechanical engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I am involved in a program called New Engineering Education Transformation (NEET) in the autonomous machines thread. With NEET, I am completing a project based curriculum focused on designing, building, and programming autonomous machines. I am excited to display some of the projects I have worked on!</p>

    <h2 class="w3-wide" id = "agelab"> <u> MIT Agelab (Summer 2021) </u> </h2>
    <p>For Summer 2021, I worked with the MIT Agelab doing mechanical design. The Agelab is studying how people interact with autonomous driving features in cars. Various sensors must be installed in the participants cars to collect data on the drivers. I completed multiple mechanical projects over the summer, and a few are displayed below. I will be working with the Agelab through the Fall 2021 semester.</p>
    
    <h4> Rider 2.0 Enclosure </h4>
    <p>One of the main projects over the summer was designing a custom enclosure for the various components installed in the cars. </p>
    
    <h5> Part 1: Inner Template</h5>
    <p>The first design requirement was the size of the enclosure. Since the sensors are installed in volunteersâ€™ vehicles, we want to minimize the space occupied. The inner template organizes and provides a designated location for each electrical component. The enclosure holds two raspberry pis with sensor hats, a buck converter, ethernet switch, USB hub, custom printed circuit board, and two solid state drives. The wiring of these components also provides an extra challenge to configuration. After a few iterations, the inner template was completed and the surrounding box could be designed.</p>

    <img src="template.jpg" class="w3-round w3-margin-bottom" alt="template" style="width:80%">

    <h5> Part 2: Box </h5>
    <p>Every month the solid state drives inside the enclosure are swapped. Because of this, accessibility to the drives is important to make the swaps as easy as possible. To ensure easy accessibility to all components inside the box, the template is mounted in the middle of the box. This ensures easy access to the top and bottom of the template, as well as helps the cable management.</p>

    <h2 class="w3-wide" id = "telemetron"> <u> Telemetron (Spring 2021) </u> </h2>
    <p> During the Spring 2021 semester I worked with the MIT Media Lab to create Telemetron: a musical instrument designed for space. The Telemetron uses an IMU and produces a sound corresponding to the orientation of the instrument. I worked on the mechanical design of the instrument, taking into consideration numerous constraints including size, electronic component placement, and aesthetic. </p>
    
    <p> The Telemetron took part in a zero gravity flight on May 23, 2021, and will hopefully travel to the ISS sometime in 2022. </p>
    
        <!--CAD MODEL-->
        <h4> Step 1: Design in Fusion 360 </h4>
        <p>Before designing the outer shell of the Telemetron, the inner structure needed to be finalized. The inner structure holds a raspberry pi, imu, and two speakers. The inner rig is displayed in the image below. </p>
        <img src="inner_rig.png" class="w3-round w3-margin-bottom" alt="inner rig" style="width:80%">
        
        <p>After the inner rig was designed, printed, and tested, the outer shell was designed. The shell needed to maintain a sleek outer appearance, while having inner structure to attach to the inner rig. The inside of the shell was designed to hold the inner rig in place, as well as secure the two halves of the shell together in a visually hidden way. Images of the CAD model of the Telemetron are displayed below.  </p>

    <h2 class="w3-wide" id = "segway"><u>Self Balancing Segway (Fall 2020) </u></h2>
    <p> I implemented 3 different types of controllers for this robot: PD, PID, and full state feedback. All three were able to achieve long-term stability, but full state feedback control displayed the best performance. Below is a video displaying self balancing, and a fun configuration! </p>

    <h2 class="w3-wide" id = "winerack"><u>Wine Rack (Summer 2020)</u></h2>
    <p class=""> During the Spring 2020 semester, my manufacturing class went virtual. I was not able to apply the knowledge learned in my classes to physically build something. Luckily, my father is a mechanical engineer, who owns a lot of manufacturing equipment. I decided to take on the task of building a wine rack for my parents! Here is some more details on this project!</p>
    <div class="w3-row w3-padding-32">
        
        <!--CAD MODEL-->
        <h4> Step 1: CAD Model</h4>
        <p>The first step was measuring the dimensions of the wine cellar. After knowing the dimensions I could start designing. After searching through pinterest for design inspiration, I landed on two designs. In Solidworks, I was able to combine the two designs into one wine rack, as shown in the CAD model below.</p>
        <img src="CAD.png" class="w3-round w3-margin-bottom" alt="cad model" style="width:80%">

        <!--Prototype-->
        <h4> Step 2: Prototype</h4>
        <p>Next I built a mini prototype of an X (shown on the second shelf in the picture below) to ensure the saw cut designs would fit together correctly. Then I started building!</p>
        <img src="prototype.jpg" class="w3-round w3-margin-bottom" alt="prototype" style="width:80%">

        <!--Prototype-->
        <h4> Step 3: Assemble</h4>
        <p>Next I built one side of the design. The bottom X was removed to store wine crates. Unfortunatly, I had to move before finishing the whole assembly, but will be completing it this winter! Updates coming soon! </p>

        <h2 class="w3-wide" id = "2007"><u>Autonomous Robot (Spring 2020) </u></h2>
        <h4> </h4>
        <p>For my design and manufacturing class last Spring, the focus of the class was to design and build an autonomous robot to compete on a game board. Unfortunately, I was not able to build the robot I designed due to the pandemic, but in the first half of the semester I manufactured a prototype robot. </p>
        <h4> CAD Model</h4>
        <p>Below is the CAD model of the robot I designed for the competition. The sheet metal on the back of the robot would be used to push items around the game board, and the claw on the front would be used to rotate a wheel. I performed torque calculations to ensure the selected motor has enough torque to rotate the wheel. I also used Solidworks FEA analysis to ensure the sheet metal could withstand the applied force without plastic deformation. </p>

        <img src="robot2.jpg" class="w3-round w3-margin-bottom" alt="robot2" style="width:80%">
        
        <h4> Prototype</h4>
        <p>Before the pandemic, I manufactured a prototype robot pictured below. This robot could navigate the gameboard autonomously utilizing an ultrasonic sensor and line following.</p>
        <img src="robotpic.jpg" class="w3-round w3-margin-bottom" alt="minime" style="width:80%">

        <!--h2 class="w3-wide" id = "arm"><u>Robot Arm 6 DOFs</u></h2>
        <p>My most recent project has been a robot arm with degrees of freedom. I assembled the robot arm, and have been testing the controller. Future development includes mounting the arm, and programming the arm to pick up objects using the claw.</p>
